Launch an EC2 instance in myvpc1 public-1a subnet with a 8 GiB root volume and use the below user data script to populate two applications (static website & php-watermark-gallery)

#!/bin/bash
sudo yum install httpd php php-gd -y
sudo service httpd start
sudo chkconfig httpd on
cd /home/ec2-user/
sudo wget https://github.com/tinkrbay/php-watermark-gallery/archive/master.zip
sudo unzip master.zip
cd /var/www/html/
sudo mkdir php-watermark-gallery
sudo mv /home/ec2-user/php-watermark-gallery-master/* /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html
sudo chown -R apache.apache /var/www/html
sudo service httpd restart


Our objective is to have the staticwebsite & php-watermark-gallery sub-directories on individual non-root data volumes
Browse & validate if the applications are working as desired
Create two new EBS volumes in us-east-1a each of 1GiB and GP2 type
Attach these two new volumes to the running EC2 instance launched above
Once attached, SSH into the EC2 instance
Issue the below command to see the current volumes mounted

sudo lsblk

Observe the output and you will see the new volumes attached but there is no mount-point (in other words there is no directory mounted on them)

There are 4 steps to have our sub-directories mounted on the new EBS volumes

STEP-1: CREATE A FILESYSTEM ON THESE BLANK VOLUMES
sudo mkfs -t ext4 device-name-of-1st-data-volume
sudo mkfs -t ext4 device-name-of-2nd-data-volume

TIP: NEVER RUN A mkfs command on an existing populated volume else it will completely format and erase the entire data

STEP-2: CREATE A BACKUP OF YOUR EXISTING DIRECTORIES TO BE MOUNTED
cd /home/ec2-user/
sudo mkdir staticwebsitebackup
sudo mkdir php-watermark-gallery-backup
mv /var/www/html/staticwebsite/* /home/ec2-user/staticwebsitebackup/
mv /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/* /home/ec2-user/php-watermark-gallery-backup/

STEP-3 MOUNT THE BLANK SUB-DIRECTORIES ONTO THE NEW EBS VOLUMES PERMANENTLY VIA FSTAB FILE (NOTE FSTAB FILE DOES NOT HAVE ANY EXTENSION)
sudo cp /etc/fstab /home/ec2-user/fstabbackup
sudo vi /etc/fstab

Press Shift+G and Shift+A keys to arrive at the new last line in the fstab file
On the last line you need to be enter the below new mount entries
NOTE: 
THAT FSTAB IS A TAB SEPARATED VALUE SET. THIS MEANS YOU SHOULD NOT BLINDLY COPY PASTE THE BELOW LINES
YOU NEED TO COPY EACH TERM AND THEN HIT A TAB KEY
DONT WORRY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF UNEVEN GAPS SEEN ON THE CONSOLE

device-name-of-1st-data-volume	/var/www/html/staticwebsite/	ext4	defaults,nofail	0	2
device-name-of-1st-data-volume	/var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/	ext4	defaults,nofail	0	2 

Save and exit the fstab file (Esc + Shift : + wq!)

Issue the below command to mount the devices

sudo mount -a

Issue the below command to now observe the block device details

sudo lsblk

You will see that mount points (respective sub-directories) have been configured for each device

STEP-4 RESTORE THE SUB-DIRECTORY BACKUPS INTO THE NEWLY MOUNTED SUB-DIRECTORIES

cd /home/ec2-user/
sudo mv staticwebsitebackup/* /var/www/html/staticwebsite/
sudo mv php-watermark-gallery-backup/* /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/
