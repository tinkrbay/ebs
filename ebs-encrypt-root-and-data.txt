NEW SCENARIO: Assuming that your Enterprise has laid out a new security policy to have all volumes encrypted for the application php-watermark-gallery

Launch an EC2 instance using php-watermark-gallery-1 AMI in public-1a subnet of myvpc1

Brief steps of encrypting an existing EBS data volume attached to an EC2 instance

ROOT VOLUME:
unencrypted ROOT volume > create snapshot > result: unencrypted snapshot > copy snapshot > toggle encryption settings > encrypted snapshot created > create volume from encrypted snapshot > result: new encrypted volume > STOP THE EC2 instance > detach unencrypted ROOT volume > attach newly created encrypted volume on /dev/xvda device name > START THE EC2 instance

DATA VOLUMES
unencrypted volume > create snapshot > result: unencrypted snapshot > copy snapshot > toggle encryption settings > encrypted snapshot created > create volume from encrypted snapshot > result: new encrypted volume > unmount unencrypted volume., the command would be sudo umount /dev/xvdf > detach unencrypted volume > attach newly created encrypted volume > no need to edit fstab (as fstab entries are still valid if attachment is done on same device name) > execute sudo mount -a command

Verify the mounting using lsblk command

Restart httpd services

Validate your application, which are now being served via encrypted volumes.
