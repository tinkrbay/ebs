Launch an EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2 AMI) in myvpc1 public-1a subnet with a 8 GiB root volume and use the below user data script to populate two applications (static website & php-watermark-gallery)

#!/bin/bash
sudo yum install httpd php php-gd -y
sudo service httpd start
sudo chkconfig httpd on
cd /home/ec2-user/
sudo wget https://github.com/tinkrbay/php-watermark-gallery/archive/master.zip
sudo unzip master.zip
sudo rm -rf master.zip
cd /var/www/html/
sudo mkdir php-watermark-gallery
sudo mv /home/ec2-user/php-watermark-gallery-master/* /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/
sudo chmod -R 777 /var/www/html
sudo chown -R apache.apache /var/www/html
sudo service httpd restart



Our objective is to have the php-watermark-gallery sub-directory on individual non-root data volumes
Browse & validate if the application is working as desired
Create a 1GiB EBS GP2 volume with AZ as us-east-1a and tag (key: Name & value: php-watermark-gallery)
Attach the 1GiB volume with the name tag php-watermark-gallery to the EC2. Type the device name as /dev/xvdf

Once attached, SSH into the EC2 instance

Issue the commands below to remove the empty directory (nothing basic house-keeping)
sudo rm -rf /home/ec2-user/php-watermark-gallery-master

Next, Issue the below command to see the current volumes mounted

sudo lsblk

You can observe the output similar to below
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-78-88 ~]$ sudo lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /
xvdf    202:80   0   1G  0 disk

Observe the output and you will see the new volumes attached but there is no mount-point for the 1GiB volume (in other words there is no directory mounted on them)

There are 4 steps to have our application sub-directory php-watermark-gallery under /var/www/html mounted on the new EBS volume

STEP-1: CREATE A FILESYSTEM ON THE BLANK VOLUME
sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf

TIP: NEVER RUN A mkfs command on an existing populated volume else it will completely format and erase the entire data

STEP-2: CREATE A BACKUP OF YOUR EXISTING DIRECTORY TO BE MOUNTED
cd /home/ec2-user/
sudo mkdir /home/ec2-user/php-watermark-gallery-backup
sudo mv /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/* /home/ec2-user/php-watermark-gallery-backup/

STEP-3 MOUNT THE BLANK SUB-DIRECTORY ONTO THE NEW EBS VOLUMES PERMANENTLY VIA FSTAB FILE (NOTE FSTAB FILE DOES NOT HAVE ANY EXTENSION)
sudo cp /etc/fstab /home/ec2-user/fstabbackup
sudo vi /etc/fstab

Press Shift+G and Shift+A keys to arrive at the new last line in the fstab file
On the last line you need to be enter the below new mount entries
NOTE: 
THAT FSTAB IS A TAB SEPARATED VALUE SET. THIS MEANS THE GAP BETWEEN EACH TERM IS A TAB KEY. DONT TRY TO ALIGN THINGS BY HITTING SPACE BAR...
DONT WORRY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF UNEVEN GAPS SEEN ON THE CONSOLE

/dev/xvdf	/var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/	ext4	defaults,nofail	0	2

Save and exit the fstab file (Esc + Shift : + wq!)

Issue the below command to mount the volume

sudo mount -a

Issue the below command to now observe the block device details

sudo lsblk

You will see that mount point for /dev/xvdf as php-watermark-gallery. This means whatever you read/write into this directory will be stored on the 1GiB volume

STEP-4 RESTORE THE BACKUP INTO THE NEWLY MOUNTED SUB-DIRECTORY 

cd /home/ec2-user/
sudo mv php-watermark-gallery-backup/* /var/www/html/php-watermark-gallery/
sudo service httpd restart

Browse your IP address and validate the applications

Now if you ever wanted to detatch this volume. First you have to properly unmount the volumes by issuing the commands
sudo umount /dev/xvdf

If you want to mount it again
sudo mount -a

BEFORE PROCEEDING AHEAD.. LETS CREATE AN AMI with both Root and 1GiB volumes included in the AMI. 

NAME: php-watermark-gallery-1
Description: This is the unencrypted AMI for PHP watermark application with two unencrypted volumes, 8GiB Root and 1GiB hosting the php-watermark-gallery application sub-directory
Name tag the AMI as php-watermark-gallery-1
Name tag the corresponding snapshots as php-watermark-gallery-1
